### 1. 📝 Save the script to `/usr/local/bin`

This is the standard place for custom system-wide scripts.

```bash

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/fix-time-skew

```

### Paste this code
````
Paste Time_Skew_Fix
````
### 2. ✅ Make it executable

```bash

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fix-time-skew

```

---

### 3. 🚀 Use it like a command

```bash

sudo fix-time-skew 10.129.XX.XX

```

And with this time skew problems should be gone.
